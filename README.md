## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The main problem throughout these projects was utilizing C++, I have not utilized C++ much at all compared to other languages such as Python and Lua. Lua is my most comfortable language and it is the first language I have learned. The various data structures were also a learning curve considering I have only really utilized arrays more than others.
  
## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The YouTube videos my instructure provided were great in telling us what exactly needs to be done and how to achieve what was needed. C++ resources was also essential in determining the best functions to utilize and the arguments for the functions we used. It also helped learning more about the data structures we were using to achieve the desired result.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I did not come into many problems throughout the projects with the code itself but I did have issues with Visual Studio and how to correctly import the files needed. Visual Studio is a learning experience for me and I just now started to learn more about it and how to correctly use it for compiling. It is not very beginner friendly and the import function does not seem to work flawlessly.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I have started developing on the Unity game engine after this course which utilizes C# so the information learned in this course will help me throughout that learning process. I also hope to utilize these data strucutres throughout other applications and projects so I can be more efficient in my every day programming.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
These projects showed how to take text from a file and convert them into classes. That allowed us to easily maintain the projects and efficiently maneuver throughout classes to print their pre-requisites and other information. These projects showed us how to correctly create programs and how to use professional naming structures to maintain easy readability.
